The Inpaint32K dataset is a high-quality collection designed for image inpainting tasks, characterized by diversity, comprehensiveness, high quality, and authenticity. It serves as a vital resource for the research and evaluation of image inpainting techniques. The dataset is meticulously curated from various sources, including Wider Person, Total-Text, RCTW 17, Coco, CelebA-HQ, Place2, and royalty-free images from the internet, ensuring a wide range of data representation.

The dataset encompasses 32,000 images that have undergone inpainting using four distinct technical categories: Traditional Methods-Based (TM-Based), Convolutional Neural Network-Based (CNN-Based), Generative Adversarial Network-Based (GAN-Based), and Diffusion Model-Based (DM-Based), with 8,000 images for each category. It includes three types of tampering: replacement, filling, and removal, which not only alter the visual content of the images but may also involve a complete change in the object's attributes such as shape, color, and texture.

All ground truth masks in the Inpaint32K dataset are manually created to ensure the semantic meaning of the tampered images, contributing to the dataset's high quality and authenticity. The diversity and realism of the Inpaint32K dataset make it a powerful tool for assessing image inpainting techniques, particularly for training and testing models focused on Image Inpainting Localization (IIL) tasks.

Publicly available through its GitHub page, the Inpaint32K dataset provides researchers with easy access to this valuable resource. Its creation has not only enriched the field of image inpainting with extensive resources but also contributed to the advancement of image forensics. Researchers can utilize this dataset to more effectively evaluate and refine their image inpainting localization methods, addressing the security challenges posed by increasingly sophisticated image inpainting technologies.
